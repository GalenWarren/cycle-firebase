  /**
   * Firebase Driver factory.
   *
   * This is a function which, when called, returns a Firebase Driver for Cycle.js
   * apps. The driver is also a function, and it takes an Observable of data trees,
   * as input to send to the remote DB and returns an object with methods to
   * retrieve observables of values in the remote DB.
   *
   * **Requests**. Will compare the objects passed into this (starting with an
   * empty one), and send changes between them to firebase. It does so by treating
   * everything else than an object as a value to set, and thereby not overwriting
   * any of it's parents. Only when an object with a single key `$set` is encoutered,
   * it will use the value on that key to overwrite the data on that location,
   * even if it is an (deep) object.
   *
   * **Responses**. An object with properties `get`, `child` and `uid$` to create
   * firebase value observables.
   * ### `get(location)`
   * Will return an observable, mapping to the value at location `location` in the
   * remote firebase database.
   * ### `uid$`
   * An observable over the uid$ of the current logged in user.
   * directly after calling (differs from `setInterval`), no initial timeout.
   * ### `child(location)`
   * Created a object like the normal driver, but with only access to the data
   * at and in `location`. This allows you to pass certain parts to used dataflow
   * components.
   *
   * @param {String} Firebase url to use as base
   * @return {Function} the Firebase Driver function
   * @function makeFirebaseDriver
