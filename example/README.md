# Console example using logging in

This is a small, handcrafted example using cyclejs in your console.
I didn't want to depend on webpack et all to run this, so to run it:

- Install chalk (`$ npm install chalk`) because I like colors
- Install babel cli (`$ npm install -g babel-cli`)
- Run it! `$ babel-node example/example.js`

Hopefully it is not too hard to understand :)
